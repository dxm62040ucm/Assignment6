Video:
1)
a. Dense layers are added to the existing code and executed accuracy changes.
2. Loaded Breast Cancer dataset.Reported accuracy of the model.
3. Normalized the data before feeding the data to the model 
printed changed accuracy (code given below).

2)
Use Image Classification on the hand written digits data set (mnist)
1. Ploted the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the source
code.
2. Ploted one of the images in the test data, and then doing inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model
on that single image.
3. Implemented 2 hidden layers and Relu activation. changed the number of hidden layer and the
activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens.
4. Run the same code without scaling the images and printed the performance
